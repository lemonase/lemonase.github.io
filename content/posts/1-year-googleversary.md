Today marks a special milestone for me - my one-year anniversary as a Data
Center Technician at Google! As I reflect on the past year, I am filled with
immense gratitude for the incredible journey it's been.

This experience has been far more than just a job; it's been a chance to learn,
grow, and contribute to something truly meaningful.

Sure, it is not all kittens and rainbows. There are many things that could use
improvement, more in fact than I can give thoughtful feedback on - but I do my best.
That's why we have team(s) though and as I learn more about how Google works,
I am also filled with a sense of community and comradery with the people that I
work with everyday.

This is absolutely the best part of coming into work. From the moment I
started, I was welcomed by a supportive and collaborative team that welcomed
questions and was not afraid to lift each other up or point out when things
were wrong or off.

There is always something new to learn. It is hard to find a dull moment at
times, but I am very happy with my team and the work we do.

I consider myself very luck to be here.

Here is to a great 2024!
